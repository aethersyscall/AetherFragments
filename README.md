# AetherSyscall // Fragments

A collection of self-contained HTML experiments, tools, and UI fragments.

[🌐 Live Here](https://aethersyscall.github.io/AetherFragments)

### ⚠ Experimental Status
This is a live testing environment. Files here (`/fragments`) may be updated, broken, or deleted at any time without versioning support.

If you find a tool useful (e.g., **PomoAether**), it is highly recommended to:
1. Open the file in the browser.
2. Right-click > "Save Page As".
3. Keep a local copy for daily stable use.

### Adding new Fragments
1. Drop the single-file HTML into the `fragments/` folder.
2. Add an entry to `fragments.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "New Tool",
     "path": "./fragments/NewTool.html",
     "description": "Short description.",
     "color": "#HEXCODE"
   }
